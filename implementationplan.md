# Cross-Chain Resolver Project Plan

## Notes
- Goal: Build a novel extension for 1inch Fusion+ enabling atomic swaps between Ethereum and NEAR.
- The solution requires a decentralized solver integrating 1inch Fusion+ with NEAR's Shade Agent Framework and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
- Solver must listen for quote requests, produce valid 1inch Fusion meta-orders using NEAR Chain Signatures, and demonstrate bidirectional swaps.
- Must preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for non-EVM (NEAR) implementation.
- Onchain execution of token transfers (mainnet/testnet) must be demonstrated.
- The NEAR-side agent/solver must:
  - Follow requirements in solver.md (Shade Agent Framework + TEE)
  - Be modeled after NEAR Intents solvers ([tee-solver](https://github.com/Near-One/tee-solver/), [near-intents-tee-amm-solver](https://github.com/think-in-universe/near-intents-tee-amm-solver/tree/feat/tee-solver))
  - Integrate with the defined meta-order/message formats for cross-chain swaps
  - Be compatible with 1inch Fusion+ meta-orders and NEAR Chain Signatures
- Demo must include live onchain execution of swaps on testnet or mainnet, as required by hackathon qualification.
- **Note:** Live onchain demo is a requirement for hackathon qualification.
- Bonus: Modular architecture, UI, partial fills, relayer, and resolver.
- Key NEAR tech: Chain Abstraction, Shade Agents, Chain Signatures, NEAR Intents.
- **(2025-07-31): Major discovery—/src contains a fully modular, production-ready TypeScript architecture:**
  - `fusion/` (FusionCrossChainIntegration, FusionOrderBuilder): Orchestrates cross-chain swaps, meta-order lifecycle, and advanced config (mainnet/testnet/localnet).
  - `near-signatures/` (NearChainSignatures): Complete NEAR Chain Signatures integration with EIP-712, TEE attestation, and multi-network support.
  - `order-management/` (LocalOrderManager): Sophisticated local order book, matching, fill execution, status tracking, and automated background processing.
  - Features: 8 order statuses, 4 order types, buy/sell order book, background matching/filling, order monitoring, error handling, and full TypeScript type safety.
  - This architecture enables enterprise-grade, extensible, and robust cross-chain DeFi integrations.
- The relayer system is implemented in `relayer/src/relay/ethereum.ts` and `relayer/src/relay/near.ts`, supporting bidirectional event polling, message queueing, signature verification, and persistent message tracking for cross-chain communication.
- Relayer entrypoint is `relayer/src/index.ts` and is environment-driven; supports both Ethereum and NEAR event watching and message relay.
- (2025-08-03): Major refactor in progress—NEAR relayer and contract logic split into modular services:
  - `NearContractService.ts`: Handles all NEAR smart contract interactions, error handling, and validation.
  - `NearRelayer.ts`: Refactored NEAR relayer, uses dependency injection, event-driven architecture, and robust error handling.
  - Emphasis on eliminating `as any`, adding input validation, and improving error handling throughout relayer code.
- (2025-08-03): Remaining Ethereum escrow lookup logic (including findEscrowBySecretHash and integration with NearRelayer) fully implemented; cross-chain withdrawal flow is now robust and modular.
- (2025-08-03): Secret extraction logic from NEAR events and contract state is now implemented; cross-chain withdrawal flow is fully automated and robust.
- (2025-08-03): NEAR escrow lookup logic (for Ethereum→NEAR direction) is now fully implemented; relayer supports finding escrows by secret hash, initiator, recipient, and status for robust bidirectional swaps.
- Relayer logic includes: polling for escrow/bridge events, constructing and verifying cross-chain messages, handling deposit/fulfillment/refund flows, and tracking processed messages for idempotency and replay protection.
- For the hackathon, do NOT post orders to official 1inch REST APIs; work at the smart contract level using the provided contracts. All testing/filling is local and not broadcast to the live resolver set.
- Event emission and TEE attestation modules implemented as Rust modules (2025-07-28).
- Order model module implemented as Rust module (2025-07-28).
- TEE attestation module enhanced for comprehensive validation, error handling, and security (2025-07-28).
- TEE attestation module now supports additional TEE types (Asylo, Azure, AWS Nitro) and includes helper methods for production/cloud-based checks (2025-07-28).
- TEE attestation module now features detailed error types, comprehensive field validation, event emission, and improved struct fields for security and lifecycle management (2025-07-28).
- TEE attestation registry implemented: full CRUD, admin controls, event integration, and robust validation for TEE attestations (2025-07-28).
- All unused imports and variables in the NEAR TEE attestation registry module are now fixed. Rust compilation/test errors due to unused variables/imports are resolved.
- The root cause of the final failing test (`test_registry_operations`) was a mismatch in parameter order for `register_attestation` in the test; this has now been fixed. Next: rerun tests to confirm all pass.
- The test context was corrected to ensure admin permissions; registry revocation and validation logic were improved and now properly checked in the test (2025-08-03).
- **Next Immediate Step:** Address remaining compiler warnings about unused variables/imports; consider removing or marking unused code with #[allow(dead_code)] (2025-07-31).
- (2025-07-31): Identified specific files/lines with unused variables/imports and dead code; beginning targeted cleanup.
- (2025-08-03): Cleanup of unused variables/imports/dead code is in progress.
- (2025-08-03): Unused variable cleanup in `src/tee/registry.rs` complete; continue with test files and model/order.rs.
- (2025-08-03): Unused method warnings in `src/model/order.rs` suppressed with `#[allow(dead_code)]`; continue with test files.
- (2025-08-03): Unused import cleanup in `tests/escrow_contract_test.rs` complete; continue with other test files.
- (2025-08-03): Unused variable `hashlock` removed from `test_fill_order` in `tests/escrow_contract_test.rs`; continue with other test files.
- (2025-08-03): Unused import cleanup in `tests/solver_service_test.rs` complete; continue with any remaining test files.
- (2025-08-03): Reverted variable names in `src/tee/registry.rs` to fix logic/compilation; further review needed to ensure all required variables are present and correctly used.
- (2025-08-03): Only two warnings remain: unused variable `owner_id` in `src/tee/registry.rs` and unused variable `current_timestamp` in `src/tee/attestation.rs`; these are the last items to address for a warning-free build.
- (2025-08-03): Confirmed locations of last two warnings: `owner_id` in `revoke_attestation` and `extend_attestation` in `registry.rs`, and `current_timestamp` in test function in `attestation.rs`. Next: mark as unused with underscore or remove if not needed.
- (2025-08-03): `current_timestamp` warning in test resolved; only one warning remains: unused variable `owner_id` in `extend_attestation` in `registry.rs`. Next: mark as unused with underscore.
