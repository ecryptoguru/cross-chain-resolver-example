# 1inch Fusion+ x NEAR Protocol Cross-Chain Swap (Hackathon Implementation)

## Project Status: In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-28

## Important Hackathon Constraints
- **No Production API Access**: Using local contract interactions only
- **Local Development**: Testing with local nodes and forked networks
- **Not Broadcast to Live Network**: All testing is local to the development environment
- **Use Provided Contracts**: Extending `Resolver` and `TestEscrowFactory` contracts
- **Foundry**: Using Foundry instead of Hardhat for Ethereum development
- **OpenZeppelin v4.9.5**: Using for secure contract development
