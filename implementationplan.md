# Cross-Chain Resolver Project Plan

## Notes
- Goal: Build a novel extension for 1inch Fusion+ enabling atomic swaps between Ethereum and NEAR.
- The solution requires a decentralized solver integrating 1inch Fusion+ with NEAR's Shade Agent Framework and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
- Solver must listen for quote requests, produce valid 1inch Fusion meta-orders using NEAR Chain Signatures, and demonstrate bidirectional swaps.
- Must preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for non-EVM (NEAR) implementation.
- Onchain execution of token transfers (mainnet/testnet) must be demonstrated.
- The NEAR-side agent/solver must:
  - Follow requirements in solver.md (Shade Agent Framework + TEE)
  - Be modeled after NEAR Intents solvers ([tee-solver](https://github.com/Near-One/tee-solver/), [near-intents-tee-amm-solver](https://github.com/think-in-universe/near-intents-tee-amm-solver/tree/feat/tee-solver))
  - Integrate with the defined meta-order/message formats for cross-chain swaps
  - Be compatible with 1inch Fusion+ meta-orders and NEAR Chain Signatures
- Demo must include live onchain execution of swaps on testnet or mainnet, as required by hackathon qualification.
- **Note:** Live onchain demo is a requirement for hackathon qualification.
- Bonus: Modular architecture, UI, partial fills, relayer, and resolver.
- Key NEAR tech: Chain Abstraction, Shade Agents, Chain Signatures, NEAR Intents.
- The relayer system is implemented in `relayer/src/relay/ethereum.ts` and `relayer/src/relay/near.ts`, supporting bidirectional event polling, message queueing, signature verification, and persistent message tracking for cross-chain communication.
- Relayer entrypoint is `relayer/src/index.ts` and is environment-driven; supports both Ethereum and NEAR event watching and message relay.
- Relayer logic includes: polling for escrow/bridge events, constructing and verifying cross-chain messages, handling deposit/fulfillment/refund flows, and tracking processed messages for idempotency and replay protection.
- Further review, integration testing, and documentation of relayer and NearBridge.sol required for production readiness.
- Reference implementations and documentation for both 1inch and NEAR components are available.
- Implementation plan in implementationplan.md is now synced with this plan (2025-07-28).
- For the hackathon, do NOT post orders to official 1inch REST APIs; work at the smart contract level using the provided contracts. All testing/filling is local and not broadcast to the live resolver set.
- Event emission and TEE attestation modules implemented as Rust modules (2025-07-28).
- Order model module implemented as Rust module (2025-07-28).
- Order model deduplicated and integrated in `model/order.rs` (2025-07-28).
- Comprehensive input validation and event emission implemented in order model (2025-07-28).
- TEE attestation module enhanced for comprehensive validation, error handling, and security (2025-07-28).
- TEE attestation module now supports additional TEE types (Asylo, Azure, AWS Nitro) and includes helper methods for production/cloud-based checks (2025-07-28).
- TEE attestation module now features detailed error types, comprehensive field validation, event emission, and improved struct fields for security and lifecycle management (2025-07-28).
- TEE attestation registry implemented: full CRUD, admin controls, event integration, and robust validation for TEE attestations (2025-07-28).
- NEAR contract integrates TEE attestation and event emission throughout order lifecycle (2025-07-28).
- Event.rs module enhanced: new event types, improved integration for order lifecycle and TEE attestation (2025-07-28).
- Event.rs module now supports all new TEE attestation events (2025-07-28).
- TEE module organization improved: all TEE components re-exported from `tee/mod.rs` (2025-07-28).
- Integrate or update NEAR escrow contract in `near-contracts/escrow` with TEE registry and order validation logic (2025-07-28).
- The Ethereum-side foundation is the provided contracts: `Resolver.sol` and `TestEscrowFactory.sol` (in `contracts/src`). These manage escrow deployment, order fulfillment, and interaction with the 1inch Fusion+ protocol. Extensions for NEAR compatibility will build on these.
- All Solidity contract files updated to version 0.8.23 for consistency and to resolve deployment errors.
- Note: Do not use hardhat for this project, instead use foundry
- Foundry: Use for Solidity/EVM development, testing, deployment (see https://getfoundry.sh for install and docs)
- Follow Foundry best practices: use named imports (e.g., import {MyContract} from "src/MyContract.sol"), avoid importing full files except for forge-std/Test or Script, and prefer absolute paths for clarity and maintainability (see https://getfoundry.sh/guides/best-practices/writing-contracts).
- OpenZeppelin: Use for secure contract libraries and standards (see https://docs.openzeppelin.com/)
- Reference OpenZeppelin secure contract development guides for access control, tokens, and utilities (see https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/).
- Hackathon implementation constraints: No production API access, local-only testing, must use provided contracts, and implement a local relayer for cross-chain communication.
- OpenZeppelin Ownable (v4.9.5): constructor does NOT accept an owner parameter, always sets deployer as initial owner. FeeBank.sol error is due to passing an argument to Ownable(owner).
- Shade Agents consist of a TEE-based agent (generates key/account, runs in enclave) and an agent smart contract (registers/attests agent, manages code hash, enables request_signature for signing transactions on multiple chains).
- Agent contract functions: approve code hash, register_agent (TEE attestation + code hash), request_signature (signs payloads for any supported chain, e.g. EVM/NEAR, using chain signatures and derivation path).
- Shade Agent contracts and APIs (shade-agent-cli, shade-agent-api) automate registration, upgrade, and signature flows. Agents are stateless; accounts are persistent across TEE restarts.
- 1inch Fusion+ integration requires producing valid meta-orders and handling order lifecycle at the contract level, not via the REST API. Use the Fusion SDK for order construction and signing, but all execution/filling must be local.
- All TypeScript deployment scripts must use Foundry (not Hardhat) for compilation, deployment, and scriptingâ€”leverage Foundry scripting APIs and ethers integration, not Hardhat (2025-07-29).s
- TypeScript deployment script for NearBridge contract and config utilities created; uses Foundry and ethers.js, not Hardhat (2025-07-29).
- Shade Agents consist of a TEE-based agent (generates key/account, runs in enclave) and an agent smart contract (registers/attests agent, manages code hash, enables request_signature for signing transactions on multiple chains).
- Agent contract functions: approve code hash, register_agent (TEE attestation + code hash), request_signature (signs payloads for any supported chain, e.g. EVM/NEAR, using chain signatures and derivation path).
- Shade Agent contracts and APIs (shade-agent-cli, shade-agent-api) automate registration, upgrade, and signature flows. Agents are stateless; accounts are persistent across TEE restarts.
- 1inch Fusion+ integration requires producing valid meta-orders and handling order lifecycle at the contract level, not via the REST API. Use the Fusion SDK for order construction and signing, but all execution/filling must be local.
- User request: Do not edit remappings.txt further; focus on fixing Solidity compilation errors in contracts (2025-07-29)
- [x] Research finding: For custom errors with no parameters in Foundry, the correct syntax is vm.expectRevert(MyCustomError.selector);. All other approaches (string, bytes, abi.encodeWithSelector for no-param errors) are incorrect and cause compilation errors. (2025-07-29)

- Critical bug found and fixed in NearBridge.sol: contract originally stored the full deposit amount but only held the amount after fees, causing withdrawal failures. Now stores amountAfterFee in the deposit struct, ensuring correct withdrawals and balance consistency (2025-07-30).
- CrossChainCommunication.t.sol test suite now has 100% coverage, including depositId uniqueness, dispute handling, and multi-signature withdrawal flows. All tests passing as of 2025-07-30.
